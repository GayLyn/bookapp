  This is just some content to make sure the app is working correctly.

  <p>   *NOTE: I commented out the buttons in chapter 2-5 that are supposed to take you to the next chapter. You can still get to each chapter by going to the Table of Content and selecting the chapter you want. With those buttons disabled, the button in chapter 1 to go to chapter 2 works. I am not sure why when the other buttons are active you are not able to get to get passed chapter 1 using the button. I will be working on this in the future. Once I have it working better I might write a book. :)</p>
